# Template for a feature calculator
# Name of feature to calculate is stated in the file name
# and each file will implement the `calculate_feature` function
# that takes in input our networkx graph and returns an array of 
# features (even if it returns a single calculated feature)

# A feature is a tuple of name (string) plus value (float)

import networkx as nx
